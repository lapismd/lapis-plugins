# Markdown Lint Plugin

`@lapis-notes/markdown-lint` adapts open Markdown document diagnostics into the
shared Problems infrastructure. Language-service, Problems panel, desktop
sidecar, and host lifecycle requirements remain defined by their owning
chapters.
Lapis API and Language Service host modules are peer-provided by the
application so the packed plugin shares the host's App and framework identity.

## Requirements

| ID | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| LN-MDL-001 | Markdownlint Settings MUST seed `markdown-lint.disabledRules` with `MD013` and list every default rule so a vault can enable or disable it. Stock MD018 MUST stay replaced by the Lapis tag-aware rule unless MD018 is disabled. |
| LN-MDL-002 | Markdownlint Settings MUST expose include and exclude globs for open Markdown documents. Empty include MUST lint remaining Markdown after excludes. Defaults MUST cover common Markdown extensions and skip `node_modules`, `.git`, `vendor`, and vault config trees. |
| LN-MDL-003 | Changing a Markdownlint setting MUST apply on the next open-document diagnostics request in worker and native desktop runtimes. The plugin MUST own the sole renderer provider, and the host MUST NOT add an unconfigured duplicate. The provider MUST NOT scan unopened vault files. |
| LN-MDL-004 | Markdownlint diagnostics MUST format each message as the rule names joined by `/`, a colon, and the rule description. An error detail MAY follow in square brackets. |
| LN-MDL-005 | Markdownlint code actions MUST offer vscode-markdownlint titles for the current rule path: Fix this violation, Fix all in the document when more than one exists, Disable for this line, Disable for this file, and Disable in this vault. Vault disable MUST append `markdown-lint.disabledRules`. User-scope disable MUST NOT appear. |

Settings persist through API configuration. Include and exclude globs use the
shared editor-association glob dialect, not vscode `!` negation in one list.
Code actions follow vscode-markdownlint titles, including vault-scope disable
through `markdown-lint.disabledRules` (LN-MDL-005).
