# Markdown Panels

Markdown-backed panel previews continue through the public FileEmbed boundary,
which composes API-registered Markdown contributions with the same surface
context and cleanup rules as workspace and direct embed previews.

Markdown configuration and editor feature settings remain governed by the
[Markdown Plugin overview](../index.md). They do not change the
movable-panel contracts in this chapter. Metadata parse now runs in a worker
and does not move vault I/O or panel presentation off the main thread. The
published worker import stays extensionless for Vite `dist` consumers.
Nested YAML front matter and heading-aware Markdown links stay in the
metadata extractor, not in panel presentation.
The inline Reading outline remains independent of the standalone Outline panel,
stays centered in the visible document pane instead of the full scrolled body,
and reserves inline-end body clearance for its marker rail. Document
frontmatter defaults do not override explicit embed inputs.
File Properties uses the same Mira frontmatter value editor as document
surfaces. Lapis supplies vault metadata suggestions; the dropdown is portalled
to the owner document so workspace placement cannot clip it.
Markdown panels consume published Design Core and Mira contracts and MUST NOT
resolve their implementation through sibling-repository paths or `link:`
overrides.

The Markdown plugin registers file- and vault-scoped views into the movable
[Lapis Notes Workspace Shell panel contract](https://github.com/lapismd/lapis-notes/blob/main/spec/src/workspace-shell/panels.md). This page
defines the shared package boundary; each concrete panel has its own behavior
page. Public `MarkdownEmbed` remains a string preview, not a movable panel, and
applies the App Mira extension stack.

| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| LN-MD-008 | The plugin MUST register All Properties, File Properties, Outline, Backlinks, and Outgoing Links with the Obsidian-compatible canonical view types `all-properties`, `file-properties`, `outline`, `backlink`, and `outgoing-link`.                                                                                                                                             |
| LN-MD-011 | Storybook MUST provide focused `Plugins/Markdown/Panels/*` stories for All Properties, File Properties, Outline, Backlinks, Outgoing Links, and Tags. Tags is registered and exported by the Markdown package.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| LN-MD-021 | The package MUST export app-only `FileProperties`, `Outline`, `Backlinks`, and `OutgoingLinks` Svelte components. Backlinks and Outgoing Links MUST fix their mode in those public wrappers; their shared mode selector remains private.                                                                                                                                        |
| LN-MD-085 | Markdown panel registration MUST retain the former `file:properties`, `file:outline`, `file:backlinks`, and `file:outgoing-links` view types as load-only aliases. Restored aliases MUST resolve to views whose `getViewType()` returns the canonical Obsidian-compatible ID.                                                                                                   |
| LN-MD-089 | Markdown MUST declare All Properties, Outline, File Properties, Backlinks, Outgoing Links, and Tags in one panel registry that pairs every canonical view with unique opening-command metadata.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| LN-MD-092 | A serialized Markdown return target MUST replace only the editing title action. Reading and Source controls plus registered Markdown view-menu provider contributions MUST remain available in the pane menu, and the delegated document MUST NOT become a movable Markdown panel.                                                                                              |
| LN-MD-098 | Outline, Backlinks, and Outgoing Links MUST follow `workspace.getActiveFile()`. They MUST paint from async indexed metadata on mount, readiness, relevant committed changes, and followed-file assignment. Stale query results MUST NOT replace newer state. They MUST share one follow helper and MUST NOT write panel state when a leaf event repeats the same followed path. |

### LN-MD-098 acceptance details

File-scoped Markdown panels recover after late metadata and file restore:

- They MUST resolve the followed note through `workspace.getActiveFile()`, then a root `FileView` scan.
- Mount MUST issue the indexed query immediately when `metadataCache` has already loaded.
- They MUST refresh on `loaded`, relevant `index-changed`, and followed-file assignment through one shared helper.
- Backlinks MUST also refresh when another note's committed metadata changes because that note can add or remove an incoming link to the followed file.
- They MUST NOT write reactive panel state when `file-open` or `active-leaf-change` repeats the same followed path.
- Linked Backlinks and Outgoing Links MUST use indexed link queries plus Search-backed unlinked candidates instead of cache enumeration.
- An older async response MUST NOT overwrite a later followed path or metadata revision.
- Governed Storybook acceptance MUST begin from persisted indexed data, surface an async query failure, recover after a later invalidation, and exercise live link changes without acquiring a snapshot lease.
- They MUST NOT stay empty until the user switches tabs or a layout write fires.

## Panel pages

- [All Properties](./all-properties.md)
- [File Properties](./file-properties.md)
- [Outline](./outline.md)
- [Backlinks](./backlinks.md)
- [Outgoing Links](./outgoing-links.md)
- [Tags](./tags.md)
- [Link Previews](./link-previews.md), shared by Backlinks and Outgoing Links.
  Ordinary Mira previews keep one adapter instance per App.

All production panels import through `@lapis-notes/markdown` and receive App
state from their owning registered view rather than ambient host state.

This chapter owns reusable movable-panel conventions only. Markdown editor
authoring composition, settings, and editor-demo acceptance remain governed by
the Markdown Plugin overview and Editor Demo chapters rather than being copied
into individual panel contracts. Document title-bar actions and View-menu
contributions likewise use the API workspace bridge and are not panel chrome.
Markdown application tools remain package-owned non-view contributions and do
not open, relocate, or depend on these panel registrations. Markdown now owns
only `notes_list`; bounded reads and mutating file edits belong to API file
tools. The list description prefers vault browsing over host-cwd walking
(LN-AI-108).
Their narrow package entry likewise exports no panel component, placement
metadata, workspace controller, or view command.
The document Reading surface removes Mira Editor's framework border and uses
the inherited Design Core Scroll Area as its sole preview scroll owner
(LN-MD-107); movable panel paint remains governed by the separate workspace
panel contract. Complete file surfaces establish the effective Mira `obsidian`
theme before domain contributions render inside them.
The reusable Problems view is specified under Workspace Shell / Panels rather
than as a Markdown panel because non-Markdown providers and non-Lapis hosts may
publish the same generic diagnostic model. Its live leaf badge is likewise
Design Core chrome rather than Markdown panel content.

Tags and All Properties may hand a query to the separately registered Search
plugin. That command boundary preserves Markdown ownership of metadata panels
without giving them Search indexing, query execution, or layout policy.

The Markdown and Media document views remain file-backed editor registrations.
They open through editor associations rather than panel-opening commands.
Markdown document editing composes the public API embedded editor host; this
does not make the editor a movable panel or move Markdown extension policy into
the panel package boundary. Its file-view wrapper gives the embedded editor a
bounded flex area, leaving the embedded Design Core Scroll Area as the one
vertical owner for a long document.
Former panel view IDs are compatibility aliases and resolve through the
canonical command described by `LN-WS-052`.
The canonical registry uses one `Open …` command per panel and reuses an
existing leaf before creating, activating, and revealing the documented
right-sidebar default.
Every canonical panel story lives at
`Plugins/Markdown/Panels/<Panel>` and exports the same six placement names used
by the cross-plugin panel audit. Link Preview Acceptance remains supporting
behavior rather than an additional command-access view.
File Properties value suggestions and wikilink pills remain on that panel's
owning page.
Tags and All Properties query persisted facets. Outline and File Properties
hydrate one followed file. Backlinks and Outgoing Links query indexed link
directions and only bounded Search candidates for unlinked mentions.
